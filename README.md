# Documentation for WEScover

This is a documentation project for <i>WEScover</i> (https://tom.tch.harvard.edu/shinyapps/WEScover/), a web application that provides an interface for discovering breadth and depth of coverage across population scale WES datasets, searching either by phenotype, by targeted gene panels and by genes.
